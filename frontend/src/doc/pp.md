    *   **Law Enforcement**, and other governmental agencies, at our sole discretion only in connection with an investigation of any matter that is illegal or that could expose us or our affiliates or subsidiaries to liability.

    We reserve the right to disclose aggregated, anonymized, or de-identified information about any individuals with non-affiliated entities for research, product development, marketing, or other purposes, without restriction.

6.  **NOTICE OF PRIVACY RIGHTS**

    1.  **United States Consumer Privacy Rights**

        In the United States, consumer privacy is governed by federal privacy laws covering specific industries or data uses and state privacy laws providing general consumer privacy rights. This section provides a notice of privacy rights under the privacy laws of U.S. states that provide consumer privacy protections. Residents of states offering privacy protections (each a "**Consumer**") may have some or all the following rights over their Personal Data:

        *   **Right to Correct.** If you become aware that the Personal Data that we hold about you is incorrect, or if your information changes, please inform us and we will update our records.
        *   **Right to Deletion.** You may request that we delete the Personal Data that we collected and retained, with certain exceptions. We may permanently delete, deidentify, or aggregate Personal Data in response to a request for deletion.
        *   **Right to Access.** You may request confirmation that we have collected Personal Data about you and that we provide you with access to that Personal Data. If you submit an access request, we will provide you with copies of the requested pieces of Personal Data in a portable and readily usable format. Please note that we may be prohibited by law from disclosing certain pieces of Personal Data, and we may be limited in the number or frequency of requests we must fulfill.
        *   **Right to Disclosure.** You may have the right to request that we disclose information to you about our collection and use of your Personal Data, such as: (i) the categories of Personal Data we have collected about you; (ii) the categories of sources for the Personal Data we have collected about you; (iii) our business purpose for collecting, using, processing, sharing or selling that Personal Data, as applicable; (iv) the categories of third parties with whom we share that Personal Data; and (v) if we sold or shared your Personal Data under applicable law, two separate lists stating: (y) sales or sharing, identifying the Personal Data categories that each category of recipient purchased; and (z) disclosures for a business purpose, identifying the Personal Data categories that each category of recipient obtained. Certain laws may limit the number or frequency of requests we must fulfill.
        *   **Limited Use and Disclosure of Sensitive Personal Data.** You may have the right to opt out or limit our use of your sensitive Personal Data. Please note that we do not purposely collect Personal Data that qualifies as "sensitive" under privacy laws and in no case would we disclose sensitive Personal Data for the purpose of inferring characteristics about you.
        *   **Selling or Sharing Personal Data.** Some states entitle consumers to opt out of the sale or sharing of Personal Data or targeted advertising practices. We do not sell your Personal Data or share your Personal Data with third parties for cross-contextual behavioral advertising purposes.
        *   **Right to Nondiscrimination.** We will not discriminate against you for exercising your privacy rights. For example, unless permitted by law we will not: (i) deny you goods or services; (ii) charge you different prices or rates for goods or services; (iii) provide you a different level or quality of goods or services; (iv) retaliate against you as an employee, applicant for employment, or independent contractor for exercising your privacy rights; or (v) suggest that you may receive a different price or rate for goods or services or a different level or quality of goods or services, because you exercised a right under applicable privacy laws.
        *   **Health Data Rights.** Some state laws entitle consumers to certain details about health data collected about them. We do not intend to collect any health data.
        *   **Right to Disclosure of Marketing Information.** California's Shine the Light Act (Civil Code sections 1798.83-1798.84) entitles California residents to request certain disclosures regarding Personal Data sharing with affiliates and/or third parties for marketing purposes.

        Consumers may exercise these rights by submitting a verifiable privacy request to [legal@teal.fm](mailto:legal@teal.fm). We will respond within the legally required timeline to the extent the applicable law applies to you and our business activities. If your Privacy Request is not addressed in a timely manner, you can appeal it by contacting [legal@teal.fm](mailto:legal@teal.fm).

    2.  **Canadian Privacy Rights**

        This notice of Canadian Privacy Rights relates to Canada's Personal Data Protection and Electronic Documents Act ("**PIPEDA**"). This section applies solely to residents of Canada where PIPEDA applies. PIPEDA grants specific rights regarding Personal Data offering details on an identifiable person without the inclusion of name, title, telephone number, and business address of an employee of a business or organization. The following paragraphs describe PIPEDA rights and explain how to exercise those rights.

        *   **Right to know** why we collect, use, and distribute the Personal Data we process. We have set the required notices in this Privacy Notice. We may provide you with additional notices about other ways we process your Personal Data, such as by sending you a notice via email or by other means of communication.
        *   **Right to expect** us to collect, use, or disclose Personal Data responsibly and not for any other purpose other than which you consented. We set your expectations in this Privacy Notice and collect express or implied consent at various stages of collection or processing. If we collect or use your Personal Data based on your consent, we will also notify you of any changes and will request your further consent as needed. You may withdraw your consent at any time with reasonable notice by contacting us at [legal@teal.fm](mailto:legal@teal.fm).
        *   **Right to accuracy** of your Personal Data. Please notify us if your Personal Data on our systems is not current, complete, and accurate. We will reasonably assist you to ensure that your Personal Data is accurate in our systems and with our service providers.
        *   **Right to access** your Personal Data. Upon written request and identity authentication, we will provide you with copies of your Personal Data under our control, information about the ways in which that information is being used and a description of the individuals and organizations to whom that information has been disclosed. Some Personal Data may be unavailable if we are limited by law or determine there is a potential for infringement on another's privacy rights. If we must refuse an access request, we will notify you in writing, document the reasons for refusal, and outline further steps that are available to you.

    3.  **European and United Kingdom Privacy Rights**

        We adopted this section to comply with the General Data Protection Regulations ("**GDPR**") and its counterpart regulation applicable to residents of the United Kingdom. This section applies solely to residents of the European Economic Area and the United Kingdom. If you are subject to GDPR protections, you have the following privacy rights:

        *   **Right to know** how we process your Personal Data. We have set the required notices in this Privacy Notice, and we may provide you with additional notices about other ways we process your Personal Data.

        *   **Right to access** your Personal Data. You can request to access your Personal Data. Upon request, we will provide you with a copy of your Personal Data, along with details about the types of Personal Data we process, why we process it, and any third parties we work with to collect Personal Data on our behalf. We may have one or more legally valid reasons to refuse your request in whole or in part, for example, to protect the rights of other individuals.
        *   **Right to erasure** (a.k.a. the "**right to be forgotten**"). Upon request, we will delete your Personal Data under certain circumstances and where required by law. This right is not absolute, and we may be entitled to retain and process your Personal Data despite your request. If you make this request, we balance certain legal, contractual, and business interests against your right to request the deletion of your Personal Data.
        *   **Right to data portability.** In some circumstances, we are required to provide your Personal Data to another organization at your request and in a structured, commonly used machine-readable format, so that the other organization can read and use it.
        *   **Right to object** to certain processing of your Personal Data. Upon your request, and in certain circumstances and where we are required to do so by law, we will limit our processing of your Personal Data as you request.
        *   **Right to not be subject to Automated Decision-Making ("ADM").** We do not use ADM in a manner that produces legal effects concerning or significantly affecting any individual.

        If you are subject to GDPR protections and you believe we are unlawfully processing your Personal Data, you have the right to complain to [your local data protection supervisory authority](http://ec.europa.eu/justice/data-protection/bodies/authorities/index_en.htm).

The Services are designed with data security in mind to continuously protect your data and our systems. We maintain internal policies to govern the collection, processing, and handling of data. Access to Personal Data is limited to employees and contractors as needed to perform their job functions. Anyone with this access is subject to strict contractual confidentiality obligations and may be disciplined or terminated if they fail to meet these obligations. We also ensure that our employees, contractors, and agents responsible for handling privacy inquiries are informed of applicable legal requirements and we restrict access to those who need that information to process it.

    Please note that no transmission of data over the internet is 100% secure, and we cannot guarantee that unauthorized third parties will not defeat our security measures or use your Personal Data for improper purposes. Users are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of their login credentials and account access.

8.  **CROSS-BORDER DATA TRANSFERS**

    We are owned and operated in the United States. We use technical infrastructure in the United States and other jurisdictions to provide our Services to Users wherever they are located. This means data must sometimes be transferred across jurisdictional boundaries. When your information is moved from your home country to another country, the laws and rules that protect your Personal Data in the country to which your information is transferred may be different from those of the country where you live. For example, if your information is in the United States, it may be accessed by government authorities in accordance with U.S. law.

    We are committed to transferring Personal Data using a lawful data transfer mechanism. Specifically, when we transmit data from the EU, UK, or Switzerland to the U.S. or other jurisdictions, we do so pursuant to the standard contract clauses approved by the European Commission and employ those security measures required by the country in question to secure the data. Any such transfer is performed on the legal basis that the transfer is necessary to provide you with the Services.

    We do not warrant that the Services are appropriate or authorized for use in any other jurisdictions. Each User is solely responsible for determining whether their use of our Services complies with applicable laws. Your use of our Services constitutes your consent to the transfer and processing of your Personal Data as described in this section.

9.  **THIRD-PARTY PLATFORMS**

    The Services may integrate with third-party websites, calendar services, or platforms. We are not responsible for and have no ability to control the privacy and data collection, use, and disclosure practices of any third party.
